In AWS 
key stores are two types 1. public and 2.private key stores
firewall is nothing but security group in aws.
in security group we need to all the traffice 
 1. inbound traffic = incomining traffic
 in inbound traffic we allow all  and next we add ssh secured socket shell. and ssh port is 22 and then we add my laptop in aws console
 2. outbount traffic= outgoing traffic (eg after entering home ppl may go back in coming way)
